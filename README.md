  OpenCV Learning Series

A hands-on repository documenting my progressive learning and implementation of **Computer Vision** using **OpenCV**. This repository includes practical code, concept-wise breakdowns, and sample projects from foundational image operations to real-time video processing.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Develop an applied understanding of **OpenCV** using Python.
- Learn and implement image processing techniques and video analysis.
- Explore morphological operations, thresholding, contours, edge detection, and more.
- Build a strong foundation for advanced computer vision and deep learning tasks.
